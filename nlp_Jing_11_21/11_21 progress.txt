Bug report:

1. Do not use “total” in user query
2. If we want to have the ability to SELECT multiple attributes, we need to differentiate between attributes of different keywords. We don’t have a way to do that yet.
3. adjacent_toekn functions have trouble taking in two word key words like “grouped by”. I just let it use “grouped” instead as a workaround. 
4. New function “next_token”, instead of nearest, it looks for nearest but nexted.
5. Added “Calculate” to check_sleect pattern
6. A few examples require did not use the correct starting keywords. Lets only allow the query with correct key words
7. If the user use convoluted grammar, which things around, then it won’t be able to comprehend. “Ie: Group the TIME_PERIOD by SUBGROUP in CDC”
8. New function, convert_to_query_syntax
9. For the stock table. We might need to change the column name “date” since it its a reserved keyword(?
10. New function, convert_to_order_syntax
